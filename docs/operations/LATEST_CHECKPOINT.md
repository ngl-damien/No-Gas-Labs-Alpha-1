# LATEST_CHECKPOINT — Canonical — Restored

**Prior checkpoint recorded HEAD:** ea025a587e0bb3113423ea67035ddfa83ea7dc9f — historical record, superseded by Run 38 below.

**Hourly agents:** 6ac6c77de7ac81918e446a49ea330eb6 Stutter-Step Loop enabled-degraded, 6ac307e1e9bc8191ae21d22f94743802 Forensic Audit enabled-degraded — do not delete — steer via docs/operations/hourly-agents/

**Current focus:**

- PR #317 — draft Source Observation event lifecycle, child of #315; exact parent head d4185da0661f165f68764238533dae6744d6e596.
- G6 remains IN PROGRESS: actor-attributed research notes are proposed as canonical events with model- and server-side SHA-256 identity checks, version binding, replay-safe retries, Chronicle/Evidence Archive projection, and actor-scoped quest/skill projections. Verify and Genesis passed on code/test head a0eefca; Browser Acceptance passed 12/12 on runtime-identical head b35866e.
- PR #316 remains a separate Founder Gate trust-root/JWK proposal; no key enrollment or Founder identity binding is claimed.
- PR #313's Browser run passed 12/12, but Verify failed one Decision Chamber fixture test (774/775); do not transfer its Browser result to other heads.
- Android emulator and physical-device acceptance remain separate; no physical device is verified in this run.
- The top-down tile-and-sprite world transformation remains an unfinished product priority.

**Founder final authority — only fixed point — all nodes simultaneously Prometheus and Bob no tags**

**Next falsification targets:** keep PR #317 exact-head Verify/Genesis green after the checkpoint-only update; inspect its preflight receipt; explicitly exercise Source Observation lost-response retry through the shared Relay UI; reconcile PR #316 trust-root design with live authorization routes; continue G6 without upgrading authored notes to truth; advance the top-down tile-and-sprite world renderer; obtain physical Android-device evidence.

**Hash chain:** prevHash 0... receiptHash of this file content — blockHash Founder sealed — deterministic reconstructable

## Run 38 — 2026-11-03 — Worker B — Source Observatory v2

**Objective:** advance the playable institution's research loop while preserving the rule that model output, authored notes, and byte receipts do not establish truth or authority.

### Rehydration and baseline

- Repository: `ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1`.
- Current main observed at `cc317d49c8fdf003c78aa40f38a177095019066e`.
- Read root `AGENTS.md` (SHA `a4beeee1c0ec46faab28502957c0e53850b2855d`) first, then the complete shared protocol (SHA `9a26ee4c17d2462dd66e99e90d258eaa9bcab79f`).
- Read this checkpoint, the MMORPG completion contract (SHA `024144ea9995c0d39ebf073e2f9cd4da0a4eda7e`), and ledger (prior SHA `ea06c37138e86498ac66cec9de4dcb2b4ff7eb52`).
- Checked nested instructions for `game/`, `test/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, `docs/operations/`, `.github/`, and `.github/workflows/`; all returned 404, so root instructions remain applicable.
- Parent integration PR #312 was re-observed at head `d8bbea51eb74822a772f163a13eba11ef296fd6a`. It is 9 commits ahead / 1 behind current main, with the main-only commit confined to the RAE account-report file. #312 exact-head Verify, Genesis, and Browser checks passed; it remains draft/open/unmerged.
- Latest Worker A proposal #313 was re-observed at head `13c5dfde7bd0aac4467975bedc4c50de8ca9b1a9`. Its Browser Acceptance run `41598541245` passed 12/12 and the Node 20 action deprecation warning was absent. Verify run `41598541564` failed one test: `enrolled key authorizes exact decision` at `test/decision-chamber.test.js:10`, error `FOUNDER_NOT_ENROLLED:NOT_ENROLLED`; 774/775 tests passed. Handoff comment added to #313.
- Latest Worker B Android proposal #309 was re-observed at head `9de3c5617f9dc0ebfe9211ed62489003b4b4032e`. Exact-head Verify `41586444219`, Genesis `41586444189`, Browser `41586444232`, and Android Alpha-1 `41586444234` passed. Android emulator instrumentation completed 7/7; logs also show repeated ADB exit-1 diagnostics before completion, and the retained diagnostics include system_server contention and Chromium renderer-exit markers of unknown cause. This is emulator evidence, not physical-device acceptance. #309 remains a large divergent stack, not a mainline-ready isolated patch.
- PRs #302/#303 were re-observed as the original Source Observatory v2 source. #302 Verify and Genesis passed but its Browser run failed on the old v1 selectors; child #303 Browser passed 12/12, while its separate Android workflow failed. Their old Forge/Android ancestry was not transplanted wholesale.

### Current-main product observation and selection

- Main already has an in-world River of Receipts route, a Source Observatory Forge recipe, a Founder-gated draft/publish flow, retained creation versions, and byte receipts. Relevant source: `game/quests.mjs`, `game/client.mjs`, and `game/artifacts.mjs`.
- The main v1 Observatory seeded a prewritten claim/source pair and lacked a structured falsifier and next discriminating test. That was a higher-leverage research/evidence improvement than another dashboard or disconnected feature.
- The Alpha-1 donor audit, `src/evidence/content-addressed.js`, and `src/world/guild-hall.js` were inspected. The local receipt helper verifies bytes, not truth; Guild authorization uses `isVerifiedAuthorization`. No external donor code was copied.

### Change delivered

- Branch: `game/source-observatory-v2-on-preflight-20261103`.
- Parent: PR #312 exact head `d8bbea51eb74822a772f163a13eba11ef296fd6a`.
- Draft child PR: #314 — https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/pull/314
- Code head at verification: `fac4ee47a9f1d06bc470bb47ef46506c15205214`.
- Changed paths:
  - `game/artifacts.mjs`: replace the seeded v1 Observatory with an empty v2 notebook. It captures claim, author-selected source class, source/attribution, possible falsifier, uncertainty, and next test. Model assertions are leads only; tool output is attributed output, not independent verification. Unknowns export as JSON null. User text is rendered through `textContent`; unknown/prototype source-class values fail closed.
  - `test/game-artifacts.test.mjs`: six Node VM tests cover empty state, model-assertion boundary, provenance/export schema, null unknowns, hostile text, required attribution, 100-observation cap, prototype source classes, and Unicode limits.
  - `scripts/verify-browser.py`: exercise the v2 notebook in the existing two-session world journey and check the exact JSON assurance/export contract.
  - `package.json` and `test/agent-governance.test.mjs`: declare and assert all three implementation/test/browser paths in the hosted preflight target list.
- HTML input maxlength is 1000 UTF-16 code units while script validation is 500 Unicode code points; this allows 500 supplementary-plane characters without permitting more than 500 code points.
- The artifact explicitly says notes remain only in the open notebook until downloaded. The exported notes are not automatically persisted as actor-attributed canonical world events. No game XP, canonical event, authority, or publication gate was changed.

### Exact-head verification

All three workflows completed on code head `fac4ee47a9f1d06bc470bb47ef46506c15205214`:

- Verify [41599394285](https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/actions/runs/41599394285): **success**. Full Node 24 verification command, Python inspector, game build, and bounded institutional exercise completed successfully. Hosted preflight: `status: ready`, `warnings: []`, `failures: []`. Receipt artifact [13213682427](https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/actions/runs/41599394285/artifacts/13213682427), SHA-256 `a89464c6698eab094682c77116a225f42170c7a506c40d552f8551dc1f519c38`. The runner declares target paths; its receipt hashes instruction/protocol/vendor/checkpoint inputs, not every target-file byte.
- Genesis Evidence Invariant [41599393387](https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/actions/runs/41599393387): **success**.
- Browser Acceptance [41599393505](https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/actions/runs/41599393505): **success, 12/12 journeys**. Observed desktop, phone, institutional-location actions, two-session shared world, 320/360/412 px phone toolbar, 320/412 px one-button layouts, standalone file, exact bytes, and shared restart. The institutional journey observed five locations, one moonshot proposal/world object, two experiment reports, two research activity objects, one creation, and 100 publication XP. Artifact [13214255888](https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/actions/runs/41599393505/artifacts/13214255888), 5,283,838 bytes, SHA-256 `dacccc0cb23bc5cc2ce7ea4f21cf56b8bbae53c825a9b35d176f249dc2c949b8`.

No local Node 24 execution is claimed because no authorized local checkout/runtime was available. No physical Android-device acceptance is claimed. Browser workflow still emits a Node 20 action deprecation warning because its current-main workflow uses older action versions; Worker A's separate #313 action-upgrade proposal removes that warning in its Browser run but has the unrelated Verify fixture failure above.

### Gate state and handoff

- G6 remains **IN PROGRESS**, not complete: the research notebook is playable and browser-verified, but its notes are local exports rather than durable actor-attributed shared-world events.
- Main is unchanged. PR #314 is draft/open and depends on #312. No merge, release, deployment, external publication, credential/permission change, Founder decision, or canonical game-state mutation occurred.
- Next highest-value game action: design an append-only, actor-attributed Source Observation event with strict schema/source bounds, idempotent retry, offline recovery, and deterministic world projection. Keep model assertions and tool receipts as leads/attributed output only; require independent evidence and the proper human gate for consequential transitions.
- Visual direction remains a separate unfinished product priority: classic top-down tile-and-sprite world rendering. This run did not deliver that transformation.



---

## Run 39 — 2026-11-03 — Worker B — Source Observation events and projections

**Objective:** convert the Source Observatory's exported notes into bounded, actor-attributed, retry-safe world events that appear in the Evidence Archive and Chronicle and produce deterministic actor-scoped quest/skill projections without awarding XP or asserting truth.

### Rehydration and baseline

- Repository: `ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1`.
- Current main rechecked at `cc317d49c8fdf003c78aa40f38a177095019066e`; main was not changed.
- Read root `AGENTS.md` first (SHA `a4beeee1c0ec46faab28502957c0e53850b2855d`), then the complete canonical `docs/operations/RALPH_SHARED_HOURLY_SCHEDULER_PROTOCOL.md` (SHA `9a26ee4c17d2462dd66e99e90d258eaa9bcab79f`).
- Read the latest durable checkpoint (SHA `8a26ab65058c117fc778d78a30f5a74246cc2ee6`), MMORPG completion contract (SHA `024144ea9995c0d39ebf073e2f9cd4da0a4eda7e`), and ledger (SHA `1fd18b5b8fb970eb571609ef1ab2aae6e575551c`).
- Checked applicable nested instructions for `game/`, `test/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, and `docs/operations/`; each returned 404, so root instructions remain applicable.
- Parent PR #315 was re-observed as draft/open, exact head `d4185da0661f165f68764238533dae6744d6e596`, branch `integration/preflight-target-fingerprints-observatory-20261103`, child of #314. Its exact-head Verify [41605909581](https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/actions/runs/41605909581), Genesis [41605909973](https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/actions/runs/41605909973), and Browser [41605909732](https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/actions/runs/41605909732) passed; Browser reported 12/12 journeys. These parent results do not verify this child.
- PR #314 remains a draft child of #312; its exact-head Verify, Genesis and Browser results are recorded in Run 38. Its notebook export is not canonical shared-world state.
- Latest Worker A PR #313 was re-observed: Browser Acceptance passed 12/12, but Verify failed the Decision Chamber fixture `enrolled key authorizes exact decision` (`FOUNDER_NOT_ENROLLED:NOT_ENROLLED`, 774/775). Its Browser result is not transferred to this branch.
- PR #316 was re-observed as a separate draft Founder Gate/JWK trust-root proposal based on #312. It was not transplanted; no key was enrolled or changed.
- No authorized local checkout or Node 24 runtime was available. Local preflight and local test execution are not claimed. The new exact-head hosted workflows must supply the preflight receipt and verification.

### Donor and implementation selection

- Reused the existing `artifactReceipt` SHA-256 helper for deterministic normalized note identity, not as evidence of truth.
- Reused the existing shared-action pending receipt and exact-request retry path in the client Relay for offline/lost-response recovery; no second queue was invented.
- Reused existing Chronicle, character-sheet, and quest projection patterns rather than creating a parallel dashboard or separate progress store.
- Rechecked Alpha-1's existing research-records, model/server action boundary, character projection, quest trail, Chronicle and client Relay patterns. No external donor code was copied. RAE/Mesh/RuneUX/AGP repositories with missing root instructions were not opened or treated as trusted donor sources.

### Change delivered

- Branch: `game/source-observation-import-events-20261103`.
- Draft child PR #317: https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/pull/317
- Parent: PR #315 exact head `d4185da0661f165f68764238533dae6744d6e596`.
- Verified code/test head before this checkpoint-only update: `a0eefca10c4ddc732cdc0b19ad5f8a2bd25e0889`.
- Changed paths:
  - `game/research-records.mjs`: strict exact-shape parser for `ngl.source-observatory.v2`; 1–100 observations; 500 Unicode code points per field; known self-classified source kinds; explicit `NOT_PERFORMED`, `LEADS_ONLY`, and `NOT_EXECUTED` assurance; normalized actor/role/target/version/note identity; deterministic projection that fails closed on malformed, duplicate, unavailable, or ambiguous records.
  - `game/model.mjs`: append-only `source-observation-recorded` action; requires one retained, earlier published Source Observatory version; validates the normalized identity with Web Crypto SHA-256 against the authenticated actor and note fields; preserves claim, source class, attribution, falsifier, uncertainty, next test, and explicit assurance; exact duplicate returns the original world/revision; conflicting reuse fails.
  - `game/server.mjs`: exact action schema; server recomputes the SHA-256 identity from authenticated actor and note content; validates the retained version/publication chronology and event history; mismatched IDs fail; exact replay does not commit a new revision.
  - `game/client.mjs`: Evidence Archive import panel; explicit user-selected target version; 512 KiB file bound; stable deterministic request ID; reuses Relay pending-action receipt for shared-mode retry; displays attributed notes and epistemic limits.
  - `game/chronicle.mjs`: notes become visible research-note Chronicle objects linked to the selected retained version, with explicit model-assertion/tool-output warnings and no truth upgrade.
  - `game/character-sheet.mjs`: Source Recorder skill counts only the current actor's uniquely linked notes; it awards no XP.
  - `game/quests.mjs`: Founder and Witness source-observation objectives use actor-scoped records and route an unfinished player to the Evidence Archive.
  - Tests: `test/game-artifacts.test.mjs`, `test/game-model.test.mjs`, `test/game-server.test.mjs`, `test/game-character-sheet.test.mjs`, `test/game-quests.test.mjs`, and `test/chronicle.test.mjs`.
  - `scripts/verify-browser.py`: private-world journey now creates/publishes a Source Observatory, imports a falsifiable note, re-imports the same note, and checks one retained note, Source Recorder, quest completion, and unchanged XP.
  - `package.json` and `test/agent-governance.test.mjs`: declare/assert the changed runtime, tests, and browser journey as hosted preflight targets.

### Epistemic and authority boundary

- The importer chooses the target version. The exported JSON does not cryptographically prove it originated from that version; the UI and Chronicle state this limitation.
- Source retrieval, independent verification, and execution remain explicitly `NOT_PERFORMED`/`NOT_EXECUTED`.
- Model assertions remain leads only; tool output is attributed output, not independent verification.
- A note does not grant XP, approval, authority, publication, truth status, or a consequential transition. The existing publication and Founder Gate paths are unchanged.
- The normalized digest identifies actor + selected version + normalized note bytes. It is not a signature, source receipt, export-origin proof, or trust anchor.

### Exact-head verification

- Exact-head Verify on code/test head `a0eefca10c4ddc732cdc0b19ad5f8a2bd25e0889` passed: [run 41622456233](https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/actions/runs/41622456233). Node 24.22.1 full test command, Python inspector, game package build, and bounded institutional exercise all exited 0. The hosted preflight reported `ready`, `warnings: []`, and `failures: []`; receipt artifact [13224132309](https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/actions/runs/41622456233/artifacts/13224132309), SHA-256 `f81f3501e09b8ef9d190adf9bb082782155074e7d65e5a673175bd2f73e083ac`.
- Genesis Evidence Invariant passed on the same exact code/test head: [run 41622456248](https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/actions/runs/41622456248).
- Browser Acceptance passed 12/12 journeys on runtime-identical head `b35866e9bff12ab7ccfcd9671fab1919efd65b27`: [run 41621670203](https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/actions/runs/41621670203). The later `a0eefca` commit changed only `test/game-server.test.mjs` to add a negative server digest test; it did not change runtime or browser code. Browser artifact [13224550449](https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/actions/runs/41621670203/artifacts/13224550449), SHA-256 `1d509396d7dfa9ad1d2f203e84de2c5481614979029972c2d3cbf7ec96999f38`.
- This checkpoint/ledger commit is documentation-only; it changes no runtime or test code. Its exact-head Verify/Genesis checks are expected to re-run against the new checkpoint bytes. No local Node 24 run, physical Android-device acceptance, merge, release, deployment, Founder decision, credential change, or canonical state mutation outside the proposed branch is claimed.

### Gate state and handoff

- G6 remains **IN PROGRESS**, not complete. The notebook now has a proposed event lifecycle and deterministic world projections, but no external source retrieval or independent verification is performed and the export origin remains user-selected/unproven.
- PR #317 is a draft child of #315; #315 is a draft child of #314; #314 is a draft child of #312. Do not merge this child independently of its parent stack.
- Next: explicitly test the Source Observation import through the shared-mode Relay pending receipt by committing on the server and dropping the first response, then retrying through Relay and proving one event/revision. The current browser run exercises private import/re-import; the HTTP test exercises shared idempotent replay, but the new action's combined UI/offline path is not yet independently exercised. Continue to preserve dissent, falsifiers, and unknowns as authored records, not verdicts.
- The classic top-down tile-and-sprite world renderer and physical Android-device acceptance remain unfinished product priorities.

## Run 40 — 2026-11-03 — Worker B — Source Observatory offline and ambiguous-outcome recovery

**Repository:** ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1  
**Main baseline observed:** cc317d49c8fdf003c78aa40f38a177095019066e  
**Canonical candidate:** PR #320, branch game/source-observation-in-world-form-20261103, code/test head be516a5a1f11182afea95dd070fee0aa945cee04, child of PR #317 exact base abc71df5965864cefd46adcdccf6c3b660bd4282 → #315 → #314 → #312.

### Rehydration and ownership

- Read current root AGENTS.md and the complete docs/operations/RALPH_SHARED_HOURLY_SCHEDULER_PROTOCOL.md; their Git blob identities matched between main and the PR #320 branch. Hosted preflight also fingerprinted both exact files.
- Read the preceding durable checkpoint (Run 39), MMORPG_COMPLETION_CONTRACT.md, and the full MMORPG_COMPLETION_LEDGER.md.
- Checked nested instructions for docs/, docs/operations/, docs/operations/hourly-agents/, src/, src/authority/, src/institution/, test/, game/, and scripts/; all returned 404. Root instructions remain applicable.
- No pre-edit local portable preflight or local Node 24 test was possible: Remote Desktop Commander returned no online device, and the available container has Node 22 while the repository requires Node 24. Hosted Verify ran the canonical CI preflight after the change; that receipt is post-change evidence.
- Re-read Worker A's latest security result, PR #316 head dbcf3d916a7b5cef5d3368e8e2a02666ce4095c8. Its new regression preserves the nonce ledger and lock after post-rename directory-fsync uncertainty; its exact-head Verify, Genesis, and Browser workflows passed. It remains helper-level: no host trust root or Founder key was provisioned, and the live game server does not import its authorization helper.
- Re-read Worker A's PR #321 steering/portfolio update. It is documentation-only and preserves the linked-repository bootstrap gates.
- Reconciled overlapping Source Observatory work: #318 remains a separate overlapping implementation with a Browser quest-projection failure; #319 is a separate import-path Relay test proposal with Verify and Browser failures; #317 is the evidence-green event core; #320 is the canonical direct-form child being extended here. Do not merge #318/#319 independently or duplicate their changes.
- Main's game/model.mjs, game/server.mjs, game/client.mjs, game/quests.mjs, and game/research-records.mjs still do not contain the proposed record-source-observation action, direct form, projector, or Source Recorder. The feature remains proposed, not integrated on main.

### Selection and change

The highest-leverage remaining gap on the current candidate was not another note form: it was proof that the existing in-world Source Observation action survives both sides of unreliable connectivity without manufacturing canonical state.

This run changed only scripts/verify-browser.py on PR #320. The executable browser journey now verifies two distinct failure modes:

1. **Failure before server receipt:** the browser request is aborted before it reaches the service. The exact local Relay receipt survives; an independent state read observes no Source Observation event, no revision increase, and no XP. The Witness retries the exact actor/action/request ID through The Relay; the server then retains exactly one event and one revision.
2. **Commit followed by lost response:** a second, distinct note is committed by the service, but the browser receives a simulated 503. An independent API state read observes the second event and revision before the Relay retry. Retrying the exact receipt leaves two total events and the same revision—no third event or extra progression.

The same journey checks actor/role and retained-version binding, stable observation/request identity, fixed NOT_PERFORMED / LEADS_ONLY / NOT_EXECUTED assurance fields, unchanged XP, actor-scoped quest completion, Source Recorder projection, Chronicle/Evidence Archive visibility, second-session visibility, and text-only rendering of user content.

The runtime feature already present in PR #320 remains a direct in-world form on each retained Observatory version, using the #317 server-validated append-only event, existing Relay receipt, and deterministic projections. Recording a note is attributed research activity, not source retrieval, independent verification, a truth verdict, approval, XP, or authority.

### Exact-head verification — code/test head be516a5a1f11182afea95dd070fee0aa945cee04

- Verify [41628266077](https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/actions/runs/41628266077): **success**. Node 24 node --test exit 0; Python inspector exit 0; game package build exit 0; bounded institutional exercise passed. Preflight artifact [13225953863](https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/actions/runs/41628266077/artifacts/13225953863): ready, 45 targets, 48 file records, zero warnings and zero failures. Receipt JSON SHA-256 7e0787f6ce994d4af62e5e4d31f9e96d1d0c882e1425b224827acc95896ad900.
- Genesis Evidence Invariant [41628266145](https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/actions/runs/41628266145): **success**.
- Browser Acceptance [41628266063](https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/actions/runs/41628266063): **success**, 12/12 journeys. The two-session shared journey includes both new Source Observation recovery cases. Artifact [13226508337](https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/actions/runs/41628266063/artifacts/13226508337), SHA-256 e45539d80aba011209256d6353f97cd65ccb47f8da8cb861e923487be20284bf.
- The Browser run also passed desktop, phone, five institutional locations, two-session shared world, 320/360/412 px toolbar checks, one-button layouts, standalone export, exact-byte checks, and shared restart. Its logs retain Node 20 action deprecation and Node punycode / url.parse deprecation warnings; these are workflow/runtime warnings, not failed journeys.

### Boundaries and handoff

- PR #320 remains open/draft and must travel with its parent stack; no merge, release, deployment, key operation, permission change, or Founder decision occurred.
- G6 remains **IN PROGRESS**. Main has not received this stack. Source retrieval, independent verification, and execution remain NOT_PERFORMED / NOT_EXECUTED; user/model-authored notes do not establish the truth of claims.
- No physical Android-device acceptance is claimed. Browser acceptance is hosted Chromium on Ubuntu, not an Android device. The classic top-down tile-and-sprite world renderer remains unfinished, as does live Founder identity/key custody and cryptographic authorization integration.
- Next: reconcile the parent stack and exact-head evidence before any integration; then build an actual source-retrieval/inspection path that preserves origin, retrieved bytes, independent verification, falsifiers, and dissent as separate states. Keep the pixel-art world renderer and physical Android acceptance as distinct product gates.

## Run 41 — 2026-11-03 — Worker B — Source Observation dissent and exact Relay retry verification

**Repository:** ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1  
**Main baseline observed:** `cc317d49c8fdf003c78aa40f38a177095019066e`  
**Proposed stack:** PR #323, branch `game/source-observation-dissent-20261103`, code/test head `9074aaaa7642ec9b205cc5aee742a00db3022224`; child of PR #320 exact parent head `887c81272df8bf11ebe8b39c49bfbc354fd35dac` → #317 → #315 → #314 → #312.

### Rehydration and coordination

- Read root `AGENTS.md` and the complete canonical shared protocol sequentially on this branch; the GitHub blob identities match the mainline copies. Read the Run 40 checkpoint, the full MMORPG completion ledger and contract.
- Checked nested instructions for `game/`, `test/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, and `docs/operations/`; all returned 404. Root instructions remain applicable.
- Local preflight and local Node 24 tests were unavailable: no Remote Desktop Commander device was online, and the container has Node 22 while the repository requires Node 24. The manual instruction sequence was followed. The exact-head hosted preflight ran after the edits and is recorded below; it is post-change evidence, not a pre-edit receipt.
- Rechecked Worker A's latest relevant work: PR #321 exact head `67a2534a5a266905870036593388e55479c5ee53` had Verify, Genesis and Browser all successful; PR #316 exact head `206e617510f63098018513c77621be673dc92f2c` had Genesis successful while Verify/Browser were still running/pending at last inspection; PR #309 exact head `9de3c5617f9dc0ebfe9211ed62489003b4b4032e` had its emulator Android workflow pass 7/7, but this is not physical-device acceptance. PR #313's Browser passed while its Verify had a separate 774/775 Decision Chamber fixture failure.
- Rechecked PR #320 as the direct parent and PR #323's changed paths before editing. No other active PR owned the browser script or the two model/test paths changed in this run.

### Selected defect and changes

The initial PR #323 head `08376e7b0c47d1d64751d2524169b7558c9765ff` had Verify and Genesis pass, but Browser Acceptance failed in the shared two-session journey. The route handler was still awaiting `route.fetch()` when the test immediately read canonical state and asserted that no event existed. That assertion unwound the browser context while the simulated response-loss handler was still running, producing a secondary Playwright `TargetClosed` error. The failure did not establish a server-side commit defect.

This run made three bounded changes:

1. `scripts/verify-browser.py`: after submitting the Source Observation challenge with a simulated post-commit response loss, the test now waits for the explicit `Challenge response lost after commit` toast and confirms the route handler has completed before making the independent server-state read. It then retries the exact pending action through The Relay and checks that the already-committed event/revision are not duplicated.
2. `game/model.mjs`: the Source Observation challenge validator now also registers challenge IDs in the same cross-event challenge identity set used by experiment challenges. The existing global identity validator already rejects duplicate IDs; this makes the shared challenge namespace explicit as defense in depth.
3. `test/game-model.test.mjs`: add an imported-world regression that reuses a Source Observation challenge ID on an experiment-challenge event and requires `INVALID_WORLD`.

No new truth verdict, source retrieval, independent verification, XP, authority, approval, Founder identity, or canonical state was created by this validation work.

### Exact code/test-head verification — `9074aaaa7642ec9b205cc5aee742a00db3022224`

- Hosted Node 24.22.1 full `node --test`: exit 0, 13.84 s. Python inspector: exit 0, 1.07 s. Game package build: exit 0, 0.87 s. Bounded institutional exercise: `passed: true`, 15.59 s.
- Genesis Evidence Invariant [41638570793](https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/actions/runs/41638570793): **success**.
- Browser Acceptance [41638570851](https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/actions/runs/41638570851): **success**, 12/12 journeys. The shared two-session journey passed with the new post-commit response-loss wait and exact Relay retry. Other observed journeys: desktop, phone, five institutional locations, 320/360/412 px toolbar layouts with 44 px minimum targets, one-button launch at 320/412 px, standalone file export and exact-byte checks, and shared-service restart.
- Browser artifact [13231309227](https://github.com/ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1/actions/runs/41638570851/artifacts/13231309227): 5,313,038 bytes; ZIP SHA-256 `dd6ef746f938979641d0101d75baead387a78c2208ee06f4e76fac60d37c8063`.
- Browser logs still contain Node 20 action deprecation and Node `punycode`/`url.parse` deprecation warnings. They did not fail the 12 journeys.

### Gate state, limits and next work

- PR #323 remains draft and must travel with its parent stack. Main remains `cc317d49c8fdf003c78aa40f38a177095019066e`; no merge, release, deployment, credential/permission change, external publication, Founder decision, or physical-device test occurred.
- G6 remains **IN PROGRESS**. Source Observation challenges are attributed dissent against an exact earlier note/version, not independent evidence that the note is false, not an adjudication, and not a truth verdict. The actor-ID distinction does not prove distinct real-world human identity. Source retrieval and independent verification remain `NOT_PERFORMED`; no XP or authority is awarded for a challenge.
- The new Source Observation and challenge event types are not yet included in the Evidence Archive/TownSquare map activity counters. `game/world-view.mjs` is owned by the separate PR #309 lifecycle change; do not edit that shared file concurrently. Reconcile that branch before adding the missing map projection.
- The world renderer remains painterly/vector rather than the requested top-down tile-and-sprite RuneScape/Endless Online direction. Physical Android-device acceptance remains unverified; the PR #309 emulator pass is not a physical-device result.
- Next ranked actions: (1) after reconciling PR #309, project Source Observation and dissent counts at the Evidence Archive/TownSquare world locations; (2) deliver the first real top-down tile/sprite renderer slice; (3) add actual source retrieval with origin, captured bytes, independent verification, falsifier and dissent as distinct states; (4) establish physical Android-device acceptance.

No merge or deployment was performed.

## Run 42 — 2026-11-03 — Evidence Archive Source Observation response docket

**Worker:** Worker B — Build NGL MMORPG / playable-world runtime.  
**Repository:** ngl-damien/No-Gas-Labs-Alpha-1.  
**Main baseline:** cc317d49c8fdf003c78aa40f38a177095019066e.  
**Parent stack:** PR #323 at exact head 749cefdf84fc8602bb09bbcd3c6ccdd0159087c6; child proposal PR #326, branch game/evidence-archive-response-queue-20261103.

### Rehydration and preflight

- Read the current root AGENTS.md alone, the complete canonical docs/operations/RALPH_SHARED_HOURLY_SCHEDULER_PROTOCOL.md alone, and this durable checkpoint before implementation inspection.
- Read the MMORPG completion contract and ledger; rechecked PR #323's exact-head Verify, Genesis and Browser results; inspected Worker A's latest PR #324 and its failed Verify job; rechecked overlapping PRs #309, #318 and #319.
- Nested AGENTS.md checks for game/, test/, scripts/, docs/ and docs/operations/ returned 404; root AGENTS.md remains applicable.
- No connected Remote Desktop Commander device/local checkout was available for the portable preflight. The required manual sequence was completed before source inspection. Exact-head hosted preflight is required for this child; no local Node 24 test result is claimed.

### Implementation

- Added a read-only Source Observation author-response docket to the Evidence Archive.
- The docket is derived through projectSourceObservationRecords and lists only uniquely linked, unanswered challenges against retained Source Observatory versions.
- Each action opens the exact retained creation/version, where the existing client/server checks still restrict response to the original author.
- Ambiguous response histories are visible but never offered as a new response action. Unlinked/malformed records remain in the Chronicle with warnings.
- Answered challenges leave the pending queue while the original challenge and author response remain in the Chronicle.
- The docket does not write events, award XP, adjudicate claims, create evidence, or grant authority. Text is rendered as textContent, not HTML.
- Added tests for pending, answered, ambiguous and hostile-text cases, including exact-version navigation and no world mutation.
- Added both changed implementation/test paths to the hosted preflight target manifest and its governance assertion.

### Verification boundary and next work

- Hosted exact-head Verify, Genesis Evidence Invariant and Browser Acceptance are required; results are not assumed until observed.
- The existing browser suite visits the Evidence Archive, but this run's new docket-specific regression is unit-tested rather than added to the separate browser journey. Add a dedicated browser assertion in a later run if the browser script ownership is reconciled.
- The Source Observation event types are still absent from the map's Evidence Archive/TownSquare activity badge matchers. world-view.mjs is owned by the still-open PR #309 lifecycle branch; this run deliberately did not edit that shared file.
- The classic top-down tile-and-sprite transformation, physical Android-device acceptance, and independently authenticated Founder Gate remain unfinished.
- Draft child only. No merge, release, deployment, Founder decision, XP award, canonical event, credential change or permission change.
